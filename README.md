## Short description
### what is the problem?
As a try to cope with the spread of COVID-19 that makes all the places which had a grouping to be closed because there is not a technique to practice social distancing like universities, cinemas..etc. As a result, some businesses had great losses, and also education lost it's brightness when it started to be virtual. with Halls's app, we can bring life back to these places safely by applying social distancing.


### How can technology help?
We try to make a solution to bring life back to these places by applying social distancing as we distribute the people in any hall to have the minimum safe distance 1 meter from each person in any direction. when the life brought back to theses place the more people will cope with the spread of the virus with minimal loss and less mental pressure.

### The idea
It's imperative that learning in universities, also the films in cinemas can continue by coping with the COVID-19 situation. providing a set of open-source tools, backed by IBM Cloud foundary and IBM cloudant aslo DevOps tool, will enable people to go to places whatever they want with safe social distancing.
